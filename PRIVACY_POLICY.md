# Privacy Policy â€” ShopDelta

**Effective date:** 23/09/2025  
**Last updated:** 23/09/2025

ShopDelta ("we," "our," "us") provides analytics services to Shopify merchants. We respect the privacy of merchants and their customers. This policy explains what data we access and how we handle it.

## Data We Access

**Order data:** order ID, totals, financial/fulfillment status, line items (product IDs, SKUs, quantity, and prices).

**No personal identifiers:** we do not use customer names, emails, phone numbers, or addresses.

## Purpose of Data Use

We temporarily access order data only to:
- Generate analytics dashboards for merchants, such as revenue, sales trends, and product performance.

## Data Retention

- **No data is stored or retained.**
- All processing happens in-memory during a merchant's session.
- Once results are displayed, no order or customer data is kept in our systems.

## Data Sharing

- We do not sell, rent, or trade any data.
- We do not share data with third parties.

## Security

- All API requests are encrypted in transit (TLS).
- No customer data is persisted at rest.

## Merchant & Customer Rights

- Since no data is retained, there is nothing to delete.
- We still honour Shopify's GDPR webhook requests (`/customers/redact`, `/shop/redact`, etc.) to confirm to Shopify and merchants that no customer data is stored.
